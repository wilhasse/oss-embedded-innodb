INNODB COMPONENT ANALYSIS GUIDE

KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND:
----------------------------

1. PAGE-BASED ARCHITECTURE:
   - Everything is stored in 16KB pages
   - Pages contain records in specific formats
   - Pages are organized into B+ trees

2. BUFFER POOL:
   - Acts as cache between disk and memory
   - Uses LRU for page replacement
   - Manages dirty page flushing

3. B+ TREE INDEXES:
   - All data stored in B+ tree indexes
   - Clustered index contains actual data
   - Secondary indexes point to clustered index

4. MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control):
   - Each transaction sees consistent snapshot
   - Old versions kept for concurrent readers
   - Purge process cleans old versions

5. WRITE-AHEAD LOGGING:
   - Changes logged before written to data files
   - Enables crash recovery
   - Uses redo and undo logs

6. MINI-TRANSACTIONS:
   - Ensure atomicity of page modifications
   - Generate redo log records
   - Hold latches during operation

7. LOCKING:
   - Row-level locking for concurrency
   - Next-key locking prevents phantoms
   - Deadlock detection and resolution

8. TRANSACTION ISOLATION:
   - Four isolation levels supported
   - Read views for consistent reads
   - Undo logs for rollback

ANALYSIS TIPS:
--------------

1. Start with page structure to understand physical layout
2. Study B+ trees to understand logical organization
3. Examine buffer pool for memory management
4. Review transaction system for ACID properties
5. Analyze locking for concurrency understanding
6. Check logging for durability mechanisms
7. Look at API layer for usage patterns

Each component file contains both header files (interface) and
implementation files (actual code). Headers are included first
for understanding the design, followed by implementation details.

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------
Most components depend on:
- univ.i (universal definitions)
- Page management
- Memory management
- OS abstraction
- Synchronization primitives

Higher-level components build on lower-level ones:
- Row operations use B+ trees
- B+ trees use pages
- Pages use buffer pool
- Buffer pool uses OS file I/O

Understanding these dependencies helps in comprehending
the overall architecture.
